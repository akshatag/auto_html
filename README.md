auto_html 
=========

auto_html is a gem for transforming URLs to appropriate resource (image, link, YouTube, Vimeo video,...). 
It's the perfect choice if you don't want to bother visitors with rich HTML editor or markup code, 
but you still want to allow them to embed video, images, links and more on your site, purely by pasting URL.

Check out the [live demo](http://rors.org/demos/auto_html).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'auto_html'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install auto_html
```

## Usage

```ruby
AutoHtml::Link.new.call('Hey! Checkout out my blog: http://rors.org')
=> "Hey! Checkout out my blog: <a href='http://rors.org' target='blank'>http://rors.org</a>"
```
